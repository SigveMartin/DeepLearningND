# DeepLearningND
Repository for work done during the Deep Learning Nano Degree Foundation program on Udacity.

Will add course projects and relevant miniprojects. The folder structure represents the core curriculum of the syllabus. 

1. Neural Network: 
Project 1: Your first neural network
In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.

2. Convolutional Neural Network
Project 2:
